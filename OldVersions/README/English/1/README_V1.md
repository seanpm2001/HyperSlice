`‚úÇÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüî™Ô∏èüíæÔ∏è HyperSlice is an AI powered tool for rapidly cutting elements out of digital media, and saving them to various output files.`

## [Targets](#Targets)

The logo of HyperSlice gives a basic example of functionality. HyperSlice can snip out different parts of the image and place them in separate files. The first challenge is to fix the HyperSlice logo using only HyperSlice.

A better example is webpages. HyperSlice can read document source code, and can snip out only content placed in specific tags (such as `<div>` `<header>` `<article>` `<li>` and more) it can do this either by reading the source code, or selecting content it sees as being in its own section. It can also do this multiple times at once throughout the page, and saving them to output files.

This functionality also applies to images and videos, but not audio. Videos can be sliced through recorded playback of up to 24 hours, although processing time and needed RAM multiplies with every second, which is something to keep in mind.
