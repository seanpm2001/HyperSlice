## [Targets](#Targets)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the targets section</b></p></summary>

The logo of HyperSlice gives a basic example of functionality. HyperSlice can snip out different parts of the image and place them in separate files. The first challenge is to fix the HyperSlice logo using only HyperSlice.

A better example is webpages. HyperSlice can read document source code, and can snip out only content placed in specific tags (such as `<div>` `<header>` `<article>` `<li>` and more) it can do this either by reading the source code, or selecting content it sees as being in its own section. It can also do this multiple times at once throughout the page, and saving them to output files.

This functionality also applies to images and videos, but not audio. Videos can be sliced through recorded playback of up to 24 hours, although processing time and needed RAM multiplies with every second, which is something to keep in mind.

## [.hypslyce](#-hypslyce)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the .hypslyce section</b></p></summary>

A hypslyce file is a project file containing instructions for snipping/slicing and output. It is an XML file.

Here is an example of a simple `.hypslyce` file that grabs all `<div>` HTML elements and exports it into an SVG image:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hyperslice>
	<hypersnip>
		<systemType="UNIX-like"></systemType>
		<file="///bob/home/Desktop/HyperSlice-Demo/Input/Test.htm">
			<target="<div>" && "</div>"></target>
			<action="Snip"></action>
			<mode="image/svg"></mode>
			<range="l1" && "l999"></range> <!-- The first 999 lines of the file !-->
			<exportTo="///bob/home/Desktop/HyperSlice-Demo/Output/DIV.svg">
			<overWrite="False"></overWrite>
		</file>
	</hypersnip>
</hyperslice>
```

When `overWrite` is set to `False`, any additional images that are generated are placed in a separate file in the target folder with the same name, with a number appended to it.

In this example, Bob is the username, and the system is UNIX-like. An HTML file is the input, where its first 999 lines are read, and all `<div>` elements are sent to a file called `DIV.svg` if more than 1 `<div>` element is selected, additional output files will go like `DIV-1.svg` `DIV-2.svg` and so on.
